# joe's dotfiles

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pnaimoli/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/link.sh
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

If starting off on a new OS X system, run `./.dotfiles/brew.sh`, grab
something to eat, and come back to a fully set up environment.
